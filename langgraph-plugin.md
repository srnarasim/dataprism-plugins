# PRP Template: LangGraph Plugin Integration for DataPrism

This Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) defines the requirements for developing and integrating a LangGraph plugin with the DataPrism platform. The goal is to enable context-driven, agentic analytics workflows, leveraging LangGraph for graph-based agent orchestration within DataPrism’s plugin ecosystem.

---

## 1. Objective

- Build a DataPrism plugin that embeds LangGraph capabilities, empowering developers and users to define, orchestrate, and monitor agentic workflows for analytics, data validation, and automation[1][2][12].
- Support seamless integration with other DataPrism plugins and context objects (PRPs), enhancing explainability, modularity, and automation.

---

## 2. Scope

- Plugin implementation for DataPrism using the official LangGraph framework and APIs.
- Support for constructing, customizing, and executing directed agentic workflow graphs with LLM and tool nodes.
- Integration with DataPrism context engineering, UI, and core plugin architecture.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### A. LangGraph Engine Integration

- Package and expose LangGraph core as a DataPrism plugin, accessible via plugin APIs.
- Allow creation of workflow graphs composed of nodes (LLM, tool call, function, plugin invocation) and edges (static, conditional, iterative)[1][12].
- Persist workflow definitions as part of DataPrism context objects (PRPs) for auditability and versioning.

### B. Agent Nodes and Capabilities

- Support agent nodes for:
  - LLM prompts (with model configuration options)
  - DataPrism plugin/tool invocation (e.g. data loaders, validators, formula engines)
  - Conditional routing and branching based on state[12]
  - Human-in-the-loop decision/review steps
- Enable chaining and composition, so output of one node/state is input to subsequent nodes.

### C. Context and Observability

- Integrate LangGraph workflows directly with DataPrism’s context documentation; link each node to related business logic or requirements.
- Provide visualization of agent workflow graphs, execution paths, and state transitions in the DataPrism UI[2][9].
- Integrate observability and tracing (e.g., with LangSmith or other tools), surfacing workflow progress, errors, and agent decisions in real time[2][6][19].

### D. Extensibility and Best Practices

- Ensure plugin interfaces allow other DataPrism plugins to register new agent node types or transformer functions.
- Support templates for common agentic workflows (e.g. data validation, text-to-sql, chart generation), with examples in documentation[7][12].
- Adhere to DataPrism’s plugin lifecycle, modularity, and configuration standards.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: Support fast, scalable execution of agent graphs with persistent state across steps or failures[2].
- Security: Respect DataPrism’s privacy and security models; ensure agent actions do not bypass permission or governance boundaries.
- Cross-Platform: Plugin must work in all browsers supported by DataPrism.

---

## 5. Quality Assurance

- Automated tests for:
  - Workflow definition and execution across node types
  - State passing, branching, and conditional routing
  - Integration with DataPrism plugin contracts and context tracing
- Manual QA for:
  - UI/UX for workflow graph creation, inspection, and debugging
  - Human-in-the-loop decision nodes and error handling

---

## 6. Deliverables

- Dataprism-compatible LangGraph plugin, distributed as a standard plugin package.
- Example PRPs, workflow templates, and sample agent graphs (markdown and code).
- Documentation: usage, extension points, troubleshooting, and UI guides.
- Updated CI/CD pipelines to include LangGraph plugin tests and deployment.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- Users can define and execute graph-based agentic analytics workflows through the plugin and DataPrism UI.
- Agent workflows are context-aware, auditable, and extensible by other plugins.
- Visual tracing and error reporting work for all supported workflows.
- Demonstrated business cases: data cleaning agent, insight recommendation agent, multi-step data validation, or LLM-guided analytics.

---

## 8. Example Agent Workflow (Pseudo-code)

// Define agent workflow using LangGraph plugin API
const dataQualityAgent = await window.DataPrism.plugins.langgraph.createGraph({
nodes: [
{ id: "load", type: "tool", tool: "csvUploader" },
{ id: "validate", type: "llm", prompt: "Check for missing values" },
{ id: "clean", type: "tool", tool: "dataCleaner" },
{ id: "summarize", type: "llm", prompt: "Summarize data quality" }
],
edges: [
{ from: "load", to: "validate" },
{ from: "validate", to: "clean", condition: "issues_found" },
{ from: "clean", to: "summarize" },
{ from: "validate", to: "summarize", condition: "no_issues" }
]
});

// Execute and trace workflow with context integration
await window.DataPrism.plugins.langgraph.run(dataQualityAgent, { inputData: myCsv });

## 9. How to Use This PRP

1. Copy this template into your `/PRPs` directory of the DataPrism project.
2. Customize for your deployment or UI patterns as needed.
3. Execute in the platform’s context engineering workflow to generate tasks, implementation plans, and tests.
