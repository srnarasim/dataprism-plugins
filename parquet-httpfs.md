# PRP Template: Parquet File Plugin for DataPrism with DuckDB HTTPFS Extension

This Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) defines the development and integration requirements for a Parquet file ingestion plugin in DataPrism. The plugin will leverage DuckDB's HTTPFS extension to fetch Parquet files directly from S3-compatible sources like AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2, providing scalable, efficient, and robust data loading for browser-native analytics.

---

## 1. Objective

- Enable DataPrism applications to load and query Parquet files hosted on cloud storage platforms (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2) directly in-browser.
- Utilize DuckDB's HTTPFS extension as the backend mechanism for streaming and reading Parquet data without downloading entire files upfront.
- Provide seamless integration with DataPrism’s plugin architecture and in-browser DuckDB instance.

---

## 2. Scope

- Development of a DataPrism plugin supporting Parquet file ingest and query.
- Supporting cloud storage URLs with proper authentication and CORS policies.
- Leveraging DuckDB's HTTPFS extension to read remote Parquet files efficiently.
- Exposing plugin API for file loading, streaming options, error handling, and schema introspection.

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### A. File Loading and Streaming
- Support for specifying Parquet files hosted on HTTP/S endpoints, primarily S3 compatible (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2).
- Utilize DuckDB HTTPFS extension to stream-read Parquet data, avoiding full file downloads to browser memory.
- Support on-demand reading for performant query execution with minimal data transfer.

### B. Authentication & Security
- Support AWS Signature v4 authentication for private S3 buckets.
- Allow public buckets or objects with signed URLs.
- Support Cloudflare R2 authentication schemes if applicable.
- Enforce CORS compliance for cross-origin requests.

### C. Schema and Metadata Handling
- Ability to introspect Parquet schema and expose data types, columns, and metadata to the DataPrism orchestration and visualization layers.
- Provide changes updates or error information if schema evolves or files are inaccessible.

### D. Integration & Usability
- Expose a clean DataPrism plugin API for: loading files, querying (duckdb SQL), metadata retrieval, and error handling.
- Provide user feedback and loading progress indicators suitable for up to multi-GB files.
- Maintain compatibility with DataPrism’s plugin lifecycle and shared event bus.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Incremental fetch and query execution for Parquet files, aiming for sub-second response times for typical filters.
- **Scalability:** Support files from a few MBs up to tens of GB without crashing the browser.
- **Security:** All authentication credentials must be safely handled; no sensitive info exposed or logged improperly.
- **Compatibility:** Work across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with consistent behavior.
- **Reliability:** Graceful error handling and recovery strategies for network issues, expired credentials, or file changes.

---

## 5. Quality Assurance

- Automated tests covering:
  - Loading various Parquet files from public and private S3 and Cloudflare R2 buckets.
  - Schema introspection accuracy.
  - Authentication flows.
  - Streaming load performance under varying network conditions.
- Manual QA for user experience, error states, and cross-browser compatibility.

---

## 6. Deliverables

- Fully functional DataPrism Parquet file plugin integrated with DuckDB HTTPFS extension.
- Comprehensive API documentation, including usage examples and authentication setup.
- Demo application showcasing plugin usage with files hosted on public and authenticated cloud buckets.
- Test datasets and scripts used for QA.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- Users can load and query Parquet files from S3/Cloudflare-hosted URLs in DataPrism without full downloads.
- Authentication methods work securely for private buckets.
- Schema and metadata are accurately reflected in the UI for query building.
- Plugin performs efficiently with typical large datasets, providing responsive analytics.
- Errors and network issues are handled gracefully and informatively.

---

## 8. Example Usage (Pseudo-code)
```
// Load Parquet file from S3 with signed URL
await window.DataPrism.plugins.parquetLoader.load("https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/data.parquet", {
awsAuth: { accessKeyId: '...', secretAccessKey: '...', sessionToken: '...' },
cors: true
});

// Run SQL query on loaded table
const results = await window.DataPrism.plugins.duckdb.query(SELECT * FROM parquet_table WHERE pickup_borough = 'Manhattan' LIMIT 100);

// Display results
window.DataPrism.plugins.visualization.render('table', results);
```
