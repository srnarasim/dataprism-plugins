# PRP Template: MCP Plugin Integration for DataPrism with LangGraph & Ecosystem Compatibility

This Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) defines requirements for building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) plugin that integrates seamlessly with DataPrism, leveraging LangGraph for agent orchestration and enabling composable, agentic workflows leveraging the broader MCP tool/server ecosystem.

---

## 1. Objective

- Develop an MCP plugin for DataPrism that exposes and consumes MCP-compliant tools, data, and actions, making them available within LangGraph-driven agent workflows.
- Ensure the plugin allows DataPrism to both provide its own tools via MCP and call external MCP servers, enabling full interoperability with the growing ecosystem of MCP-enabled applications and agents[1][2][12].

---

## 2. Scope

- Implementation of a DataPrism plugin for secure, robust communication across MCP servers, agents, and tools.
- Tight coupling with the LangGraph agent orchestration layer for contextual, dynamic execution of MCP workflows.
- Compatibility with existing MCP adapters (JS/Python) to leverage standardized transport (e.g., streamable HTTP) and discovery across the ecosystem[1][3][6].

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### A. Core MCP Integration

- Implement client and server capabilities:
  - **MCP Client:** Connect, authenticate, and invoke remote MCP servers; discover and use available tools[1][2][8].
  - **MCP Server:** Expose DataPrism plugin tools as MCP-compatible endpoints, supporting registration/discovery[6][12].
- Support both streamable HTTP and STDIO transports per MCP specification[1][6].

### B. LangGraph Agent Orchestration

- Allow LangGraph agents to leverage MCP tools as nodes/steps in their workflows[1][8].
- Support creation of multi-agent workflows where MCP tools, LLM prompts, and DataPrism-native plugins are orchestrated together.
- Track and log all agent interactions with MCP tools for traceability and observability.

### C. Tool Management & Dynamic Discovery

- Enable dynamic loading, configuration, and registration of MCP tools at runtime (support for UI and API-level management)[8][9].
- Update DataPrism’s UI to allow browsing, configuring, and invoking available MCP tools and servers within agentic workflow editors.

### D. Context & Security Support

- Secure tool invocation using JWT or comparable authentication consistent with MCP standards[7][16].
- Ensure all data and tool interactions respect DataPrism context (including PRP requirements, audit logs, and user permissions).
- Integrate context/trace logging to provide transparent, replayable agent workflows.

### E. Extensibility

- Provide clear plugin extension points for supporting new MCP transports, custom tool schemas, or ecosystem integrations.
- Maintain plugin compliance with DataPrism’s overall plugin lifecycle and extensibility contracts.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Efficient tool discovery and invocation with low-latency, supporting concurrent agent workflows.
- **Resilience:** Gracefully handle MCP server/tool errors, unavailability, and schema mismatches without crashing agents.
- **Scalability:** Support parallel use of multiple MCP servers/tools in complex, multi-agent workflows[1][2][6].
- **Security:** Adopt robust auth (JWT, OAuth), schema validation, and audit logging consistent with both DataPrism and MCP standards[7][10][16].
- **Observability:** Expose real-time execution traces for agent workflows using LangSmith or equivalent tracing frameworks[6][9].

---

## 5. Quality Assurance

- Automated unit and integration tests for:
  - MCP client/server registration, tool invocation, and context sharing.
  - LangGraph agent workflows incorporating MCP nodes/tools.
  - Security scenarios (auth, permission, rejection on error).
- Manual QA for UI (tool discovery/config, workflow composition), and cross-ecosystem interop.
- End-to-end scenario tests with real MCP servers and LangGraph agents[2][6][8].

---

## 6. Deliverables

- DataPrism MCP plugin repository/package with:
  - Plugin code (TS/Python—per DataPrism standard)
  - Templates/examples for common agentic workflows using MCP and LangGraph
  - Documentation for setup, tool/server registration, workflow authoring, and troubleshooting
- Sample PRPs for agentic analytics, data extraction, enrichment, and tool chaining via MCP[1][9].
- CI/CD pipeline covering test, security, and deployment.

---

## 7. Success Criteria

- Agents and users can dynamically discover, invoke, and orchestrate MCP tools within DataPrism and LangGraph workflows, both as a client and server.
- Support for context passing, security/audit, and error handling meets DataPrism and MCP requirements.
- Demonstrated end-to-end scenarios: Data validation, enrichment, or action workflows leveraging a mix of DataPrism and external MCP tools, orchestrated by LangGraph.
- Detailed documentation and developer samples are published and tested.
- CDN and documentation published for consumers to access.

## 8. Example Workflow (Pseudo-code)

// Dynamic discovery and orchestration of tools via DataPrism MCP plugin
const agents = await window.DataPrism.plugins.langgraph.createAgentsFromMCPServers([
"https://api.mcpserver1.com",
"https://api.mcpserver2.com"
]);

// Compose LangGraph workflow with MCP and native plugins
const workflow = window.DataPrism.plugins.langgraph.createWorkflow({
steps: [
{ type: "mcp_tool", server: "mcpserver1", tool: "entity-extraction" },
{ type: "native_plugin", plugin: "ironcalc", formula: "SUM(Sales)" },
{ type: "mcp_tool", server: "mcpserver2", tool: "data-visualization" }
]
});

// Execute and monitor workflow, with context and security handled by the plugin
const result = await workflow.run({ input: userInput });

## 9. How to Use This PRP

1. Place this file in `/PRPs` of the DataPrism project or plugin repo.
2. Tailor references, transports, and workflow templates to your project’s requirements.
3. Reference during MCP plugin planning, implementation, and QA cycles.
